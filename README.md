Transpiler To Write C++ Faster... actually will most likely transpile to C++/java/C#/Typescript/Python with a bit of work

The original idea was to transpile pointer ```type*``` to shared pointer ```std::shared_ptr<type>``` but doing that is ALOT of work for a small result so since we need an AST might aswell mess with it and add language functionality like decorators for implicit implementation of design patterns.

So far the project is about 5% done. Will add doc after there is at least some use for it.
